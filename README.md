# VidGaze
VidGaze is a combination of four products.  The VidGaze Platform lets viewers watch anything from anywhere and VidGaze Studios lets creators upload anything to anywhere.  The VidGaze MarketPlace levels the playing field and allows small video-hosting sites compete with the likes of YouTube.  Finally the VidGaze WatchDog is a monthly subscription for creators, which protects their content and investigates potential violations of Creator Protection.  Visit vidgaze.tv today!
